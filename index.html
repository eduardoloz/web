        <h2>
            W-tapping
        </h2>
            <p>W-tapping is a method in which you have sprint toggled on or holding onto it during a fight.
            Then, everytime you make a hit you press w again. This resets your sprint and this is important
            because your first sprint hit deals more knockback than a typical hit. Knocking your opponent far enough for
            you to hit them again and "combo" them. Sumo is a perfect game mode for this.</p>

        <h2>
            Block Hitting
        </h2>
            <p>Block Hitting works similarly to W tapping, but you are blocking with your sword. This makes it
            so you are blocking opponent hits and attacking at the same time. The blocking works as a sprint
            reset, and as mentioned before: a combo starter. Highly effective method for long pvp encounters, but not
            good for comboing and knocking people off high and thin places.</p>
            <p>Funny thing is that you will not see yourself block hitting if you're in Minecraft Versions 1.8+
            even when most PVP servers support 1.8.9. Due to this, you either play on Minecraft 1.7 or download a mod
            to see the animation. It helps a lot to see yourself timing your blocking.</p>

        <h2>
            Bow Reset
        </h2>
            <p>Bow rest is when you shoot your oppponent and then swifty try to hit them. The strength of the
            bowshot is meaningless, but the shot istself is the combo starter.This method is fair and works as a way
            of putting distance between you and your opponent. It knocks your opponent back preventing them from
            hitting you and works as a combo starter. There is aweird form to it, but it works a lot.</p>

        <h2>
            Fishing Rod
        </h2>
            <p>This method uses a fishing rod which knocks your opponent back everytime you hit them with it. It
            can be very spammy and allows for you to put distance when your opponent has a combo going. It also
            works for knocking your opponent back as to start a combo yourself. </p>
